# [Proposal] Tiny Car

Player will control a small/tiny physics based vehicle which will need to be driven from one position to another, the vehicle will be unbalanced and hard to control there for it will be difficult for the player to get the vehicle from one position to another without failing the level.  

The level itself will act as the obstacle for the player and levels will be small but difficult. For example, one of the level idea that I had is where two planks are laid across a river and the player needs to get the vehicle from one side to another. If the player drives the car too quick or unexpected weight is added they can break which will lead to failure. The player can be very careful and take the time to complete the level but there also be a set timer in which the player needs to complete the level otherwise they will fail and the level will restart.  

Later when I have a working prototype and it's challenging, I can start to introduce different type of game modes and obstacles into the levels to make them a lot more entertaining and in general have a more game content. Couple of ideas I had is where a cannon shoots balls at the car while the playing is driving it on a bridge and these balls can damage the bridge or push the car off the bridge. 

This game would look great in low poly models or even in assets that are created from 3d objects in unity, because it's a very simple game and manipulating simple objects that are created in unity is simpler than high poly detailed models. I will try and use simple color or gradients for the models, color key coding models shouldn't be an issue because I will be using simple materials made in unity. 

**Core Mechanics**

**Turn left, right and accelerate controls:**
Simple 3 input vehicle controller  
 
**Physics based vehicle:**
Environment can affect the vehicle and make it harder for the player to complete the level 
 
**Level that act like obstacles:**
Objects that can break if too much weight is added or small objects that can make it harder for the player to control the vehicle 
 
**Timer:** 
Each level will have a set timer if failed to complete the level before the time runs out it will restart
