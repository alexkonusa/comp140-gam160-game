Game Idea: Alex Konusa

My game idea is a small physics based vehicle that needs to be driven from one position to another, the vehicle will be unbalanced and hard to control there for it will be difficult for the player to get the vehicle from one position to another without failing the level. The level itself will act as the obstacle for the player and levels will be small but difficult. For example, one of the level ideas that I had is two planks that are laid across a river and the player needs to get the car from one side to another. Driving onto the planks fast can break the planks, which will lead to failure, player can be careful and take their time but having a set time in which they need to complete the level will put them under pressure.
